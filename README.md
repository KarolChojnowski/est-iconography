# EST Iconography

A governed iconography library with two independently buildable parts:

```text
packages/iconography/   Authoritative SVG sources, metadata and generated distributions
catalogue/              Jekyll catalogue consuming the generated package outputs
```

The separation is based on a stable output contract rather than folder organisation alone. The iconography package never writes into Jekyll directories; `tools/prepare-catalogue.mjs` adapts package outputs for the catalogue.

## Asset families

| Family | Source canvas | Construction | Default display size |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| UI icons | 16×16 | Filled paths with clear negative space | 16px |
| Icons | 32×32 | Filled silhouettes and cut-outs, normally within a 28×28 live area | 48px |

All assets are single-colour and inherit colour through `fill="currentColor"`.

## Local development

Requirements:

- Node.js 22 or later
- Ruby 3.3 or later
- Bundler

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
cd catalogue && bundle install && cd ..
```

Build only the iconography package:

```bash
npm run validate:iconography
npm run build:iconography
```

Prepare and serve the catalogue:

```bash
npm run prepare:catalogue
cd catalogue
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Or run the combined command after Ruby dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm run serve:catalogue
```

## Output contract

`packages/iconography/dist/` contains portable package outputs:

```text
dist/
├── svg/
├── sprites/
├── manifest/assets.json
└── licenses/
```

Paths in the package manifest are relative to `dist/`. The catalogue adapter copies those outputs and rewrites only the public URL paths needed by Jekyll.

## Current status

Version `0.2.0` is the first approved construction baseline. It contains:

- four approved Bootstrap UI-icon imports
- four approved EST UI icons
- four approved EST Icons
- fill-based construction and actual-size approval rules
- generated detail pages and visual review controls

New EST assets should enter as drafts and be approved only after review at their intended display size.

## Contributing

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before adding or changing an asset. It defines canonical naming, source and metadata requirements, actual-size review, approval states, compatibility rules and semantic versioning.

Approved canonical IDs are stable consumer contracts. Use the pull-request template to identify the change type, record visual evidence and make the intended approval decision explicit.

## Releases

The iconography package remains private and is not published to npm. Tags matching the package version, such as `v0.2.0`, trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml` and create a GitHub release containing:

- `est-iconography-<version>.zip`
- `est-ui-icons.svg`
- `est-icons.svg`
- `est-iconography-assets.json`

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.

## Catalogue deployment

The catalogue deploys through the custom GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

Before the first deployment, enable GitHub Pages once for the repository:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Select **Pages** under **Code and automation**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

After that setting is saved, rerun the failed **Deploy catalogue** workflow or trigger it manually from the Actions tab.

The standard workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot enable Pages for a repository that has never had a Pages site. Automatic enablement would require a separate token with elevated repository administration and Pages permissions, so the one-time manual setting is intentionally preferred.
